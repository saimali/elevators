"""
This function, given an intervention performs multiple simulations and outputs
the results of the intervention- spefifically for limited cohorting

Parameters:
paxInfo: contains passenger configurations
elevInfo: contains configurations of elevators in the building
Interv: the intervention we wish to analyze

Output: an implementation of the intervention, across many simulations:
Waiting time of all pax, queue size over time, list of loads of elevators,
list of trip times of all pax, number of stops on each elevator trip.
